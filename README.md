Coursera Guided Project Network : [Object Localization with Tensorflow](https://www.coursera.org/projects/object-localization-tensorflow) </br> 
## Project Description </br>
This project employs TensorFlow's Keras API to train a convolutional neural network to classify and locate emojis in images. The position of the emojis in the photographs is referred to as localization in this context. This means the network will have a single input and two outputs. Object localization is a more straightforward variant of object detection. We may have many items in the input photos for object detection, and an object detection model predicts the classes as well as the bounding boxes for all of those objects. In object localization, we assume that there is only one item in each given image and that our CNN model will classify and locate that object.
